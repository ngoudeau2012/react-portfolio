Nicholas Goudeau's Portfolio

# Introduction

Hi there, I'd like to thank you for taking the time to view my portfolio. I wrote this entire code base using the react framework and wanted to showcase some of my work. 

## Background

Here's a little bit about my educational/professional background. I graduated from The University of Texas at Dallas with a double major in Finance and Economics. After school, I started working at a LinkedIn top 50 tech start up called Enjoy Technologies. There I was promoted within a year and was given the opportunity to move to Seattle where I started and ran the Seattle market for Enjoy. During that time I was succeeding, however the work wasn't what I truly enjoyed. I started poking around in different technical fields and web development caught my eye. I signed up for a free coding school online and immediately engulfed myself with it. A few weeks later, I enrolled into the University of Washington Sponsored coding boot camp. 

Since I started my coding journey, I naturally gravitated towards front end development. Growing up I've always been more of a creative and front end web development allows me to express that side of me. There's something about taking a completely blank canvas and creating something elegant and easy to use.
